# AUA Digilib Text-to-PDF converter

As of 2025-08-11, AUA's digilib doesn't offer the option to export a book as a PDF. The code in this repository takes a book URL and outputs its content in a PDF format.

## How to use

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Make sure the required libraries are installed (check at the top of `url_to_pdf.py`).
3. Changed the `digilib_url` variable in the beginning of the script.
4. Run the script.
